# mod-navigationitems
This plugin implements a Moodle-content area activity that displays navigation items
that can be added to breakup content.

## Sub-Plugins
Each navigation item is implemented as a sub-plugin in the `element` directory.

### Jump List
This element displays an in-line jumplist of each of the sections in the Course.

The <a> tag is generated as a simple "#" href so that the link will remain *local* to the 
Moodle server. 

This is particularly helpful if you have multiple Moodle servers and move them around, so that 
the section hyperlinks are not hard-coded to a particular server name.
